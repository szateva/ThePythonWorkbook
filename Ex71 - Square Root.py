"""Write a program that implements Newton’s method to compute and display the square root of a number entered by the
user. The algorithm for Newton’s method follows:
    Read x from the user
    Initialize guess to x/2
    While guess is not good enough do
        Update guess to be the average of guess and x/guess

When this algorithm completes, guess contains an approximation of the square root. The quality of the approximation
depends on how you define “good enough”. In the author’s solution, guess was considered good enough when the absolute
value of the difference between guess * guess and x was less than or equal to 10^(−12)."""

x = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
guess = x / 2
while abs(guess * guess - x) > 10 ** (-12):
    guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2

print(f"The square root of {x} is {guess:.12f}")
