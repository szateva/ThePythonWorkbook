""" In this exercise you will create a program that displays a multiplication table that shows the products of all
combinations of integers from 1 times 1 up to and including 10 times 10. Your multiplication table should include a row
of labels across the top of it containing the numbers 1 through 10. It should also include labels down the left side
consisting of the numbers 1 through 10. The expected output from the program is shown below:

    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
    1  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
    2  2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20
    3  3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30
    4  4   8  12  16  20  24  28  32  36  40
    5  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50
    6  6  12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  60
    7  7  14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  70
    8  8  16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  80
    9  9  18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81  90
    10 10 20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 100

When completing this exercise you will probably find it helpful to be able to print out a value without moving down to
the next line. This can be accomplished by added end="" as the last parameter to your print statement. For example,
print("A") will display the letter A and then move down to the next line. The statement print("A", end="") will display
the letter A without moving down to the next line, causing the next print statement to display its result on the same line
as the letter A."""

print("     ", end="")

for i in range(1,11):
    print("%4d" % i, end=" ")
print()
for i in range(1,11):
    print("%4d" % i, end=" ")
    for j in range(1, 11):
        print("%4d" % (i*j), end=" ")
    print()
